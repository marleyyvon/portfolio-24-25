## ‚≠êÔ∏è Additional Projects

Additional coursework and independent projects completed during the 2024‚Äì2025 academic year included topics in telecom infrastructure security, compiler design, and embedded systems development.

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Graduate Information Security:** Focused on infrastructure risk modeling, NIST-based analysis, and telecom vulnerability research.
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Compiler Design and Theory:** Developed a recursive-descent compiler for a C-like language with semantic analysis and assembly output.
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Graduate IoT - Project Integrate:** Explored integration of embedded hardware with wireless protocols and cloud communication pipelines.

<summary><strong>2Ô∏è‚É£ C Compiler</strong></summary>

&nbsp;

Source code is available in the `Compilers/phase` folder.

This compiler was developed as part of a structured, multi-phase course project. While the project scaffolding was provided by the instructor, I implemented all core logic phases including:

- Lexical analyzer  
- Recursive-descent parser  
- Semantic checker  
- Intermediate code generator  

It compiles a subset of C into 32-bit Intel assembly.

**How to run:**
```bash
cd Compilers/phase
make                           # builds the compiler (./scc)
./scc < ../examples/qsort.c    # generates assembly
gcc -m32 qsort.s -o qsort      # assembles + links (requires 32-bit support)
./qsort < ../examples/qsort.in # runs the compiled binary
```

This process outputs a `.s` file you can inspect directly to view the generated assembly code.

**Example:**
```c
int main() {
    int x;
    x = 3 + 4;
    return x;
}
```

Produces:
```asm
        .text
        .globl main
main:
        li $t0, 3
        li $t1, 4
        add $t2, $t0, $t1
        move $v0, $t2
        jr $ra
```

<summary><strong>3Ô∏è‚É£ Project Integrate</strong></summary>

&nbsp;

Project Integrate is a privacy-focused smart-home prototype that runs on a four-node Raspberry Pi mesh (one root, three leaf). Each node captures Wi-Fi traffic in monitor mode, extracts RSSI values with `pcap`, and exchanges those readings over a custom IPv6/UDP JSON protocol (‚ÄúLML‚Äù). By averaging RSSI and applying a log-distance path-loss model, the system localises user devices to < 1 m accuracy and triggers Govee smart lights via local HTTPS‚Äîno cloud calls, no personal data leaving the LAN. My role covered the C++ backend such as the LML packet format,  root/leaf daemons, added the channel-sync to turn raw RSSI into actionable proximity events and fallback logic against noisy 2.4 GHz environments.
